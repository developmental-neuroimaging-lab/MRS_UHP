Created by Meaghan Perdue, May 2024

## Software Requirements

This repository contains processing code for semi-laser (sLASER) and HERMES MRS data. Start-to-finish processing uses Osprey <https://schorschinho.github.io/osprey/> via Matlab. Requires SPM12. See Osprey documentation for additional dependencies.

## Data Organization
MRS raw data (P-files) and T1w anatomical data must be organized according to BIDS.
